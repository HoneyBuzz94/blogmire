# Blogmire

## Description
Blogmire is a basic blogging/social media framework. This app was designed with a simple UI powered by Bulma, express.js, express-session, handlebars, and mysql2. Blogmire allows users to create an account and post into a general thread. This project has room for expansion such as allowing users to edit their account data, edit and delete posts, and create multiple threads.
